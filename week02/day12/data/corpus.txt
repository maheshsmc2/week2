Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to problems with insulin production or action.
Common symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred vision.
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, increases the risk of heart disease and stroke and is often managed with lifestyle changes and medication.
Insulin resistance occurs when cells in muscles, fat, and liver do not respond well to insulin and can't use glucose from blood for energy.
Type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and genetic predisposition.
Lifestyle interventions such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, weight management, and adequate sleep improve metabolic health.
In retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG), vector search retrieves semantically similar passages to a user query using embeddings.
FAISS is a popular library for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search that scales to millions of vectors efficiently.
HNSW builds a multi‑level graph to speed up nearest neighbor search by navigating through coarse‑to‑fine layers.
Brute‑force cosine similarity is exact but becomes too slow as the number of vectors grows into the millions.
